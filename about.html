				<h1>Currently enrolled in Business Information Technology at Red River College and expected to graduate December 2022.</h1>

				<p>I spent majority of my high school and university days studying to be a Pediatric Oncology Nurse but later found it as a profession that I soon lost interest in. Although I do still love learning about the anatomy and physiology of the human body, I didn't see myself doing it as a career for the rest of my life. I grew an interest in programming through my parents as they are both developers and would often show me the projects that they would work on. Before I joined the Business Information Technology program, I had no prior knowledge to the coding spectrum and had to teach myself all new concepts. I never saw things from a developers perspective before and how simple everyday things like a microwave came to work. Almost everything has a simple piece of code behind it to help it function which was something that became fascinating to me.</p>

				<p>From drastically switching my career path from nursing to programming, I've realized that I like to challenge myself a lot in terms of just diving into something out of curiosity. 3 years ago I probably never would've thought to myself "Oh, I want to be a programmer." because I used to despise desk jobs and vowed to never do that for the rest of my life but now that's all I see myself doing. I've never lost sight of where I wanted to be in my life and kept pushing myself to try new things which is how I ended up here.</p>

				<p>Unrelated to work, I enjoy throwing myself into new hobbies. Currently, I am learning korean, have taken up an interest in clay sculpting and pottery, and am learning how to dance. I tend to keep myself busy, otherwise I would feel like i'm wasting my time doing nothing. I also enjoy writing; mostly about my day to day activities and occasionally a poem if I really feel like it. I have actually been published in a book for my writing which is something that I feel most proud of myself for. Another hobby that I enjoy doing in my free time is taking care of plants. It feels very satisfying to watch them grow from nothing into something much bigger.</p>
